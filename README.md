# About this repo
This is a place for files which help set up my computer. I tend to do a clean reinstall of my OS every few months so this helps it stay the same each time.

## How to
Go through each file in order:
1) Edit new_fedora_install.sh so it has the right version numbers (esp. Zoom)
2) Run new_fedora_install.sh
3) Make manual changes
4) Copy Sublime settings to the location in the comments
