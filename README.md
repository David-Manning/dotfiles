# About this repo
This is a place for dotfiles and installation scripts. I tend to do a clean reinstall of my OS every few months so this helps it stay the same each time.

## Installation 
Run `git clone https://github.com/David-Manning/computer-setup ./Documents/setup/` in the terminal 

Open `./Documents/setup/new_fedora_install.sh` and update the version number for Zoom and others 

Run `./Documents/setup/new_fedora_install.sh`


## How to
Go through each file in order:
1) Edit new_fedora_install.sh so it has the right version numbers (esp. Zoom)
2) Run new_fedora_install.sh
3) Make manual changes
