## About this repo
These are my dotfiles and installation scripts. I tend to do a clean reinstall of my OS every few months so this helps it stay the same each time. These settings suit me, but they may not suit you. Feel free to fork and change. The files may not work if your system does not use Fedora KDE.

## Installation 
1) Fork the repo

2) Update version numbers (especially Zoom)

3) Tweak the other settings to your preference

4) Run in the terminal (update the account name if you forked it):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/David-Manning/computer-setup ./Documents/setup/
./Documents/setup/bootstrap.sh
```
